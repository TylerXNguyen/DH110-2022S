# Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing (UT)

### Tyler Nguyen | DGT HUM 110 | SPRING 2022

## Introduction

"A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site." -Usability.gov

**Playsongnotes.com** is a website that helps users develop their musical interests with the guitar. The site offers users videos and music sheets (with fees, some are free) of popular song covers on the guitar. These songs are sorted accordingly by age, genre, etc. Playsongnotes attempts to offer its users a balanced user interface, however, there are some usability issues with ranging severities (as seen in the heuristics).

## Purpose

The rationale behind conducting this usability testing is to address these issues to see for further improvement. The test will help improve the user experience when the problems are clearly found. The tasks will contain three parts that measure the User’s experience. It also focuses on addressing the heuristic issues found earlier. These issues include Aesthetic and Minimalistic design, Consistency and Standards, and Visibility of System Status. These problems were of the greatest severity in disputing the ten Heuristics.

1. Aesthetic and Minimalistic design (Severity level **3**)
  The home page was cluttered with unnecessary information. *Task 1* and *Task 3* helped expand on this heuristic and the proposal to address this issue.
2. Consistency and Standards (Severity level **2**)
  There was poor labeling for the songs. *Task 3* helped expand on this heuristic and the proposal to address this issue.
3. Visibility of System Status (Severity level **2**)
  Users were redirected on the website in new links. *Task 1* and *Task 3* helped expand on this heuristic and the proposal to address this issue.
  
## Methodology

We used a portable minimalist lab with Zoom meeting recording computer software to conduct and record the test. This allows for the moderator and participant to be in separate rooms from different locations. The participant was located in Berkeley, CA, and the moderator was in Los Angeles, CA. The face cameras were both on and the video was recorded on YouTube. The participant used their personal computer and I moderated them on my laptop. Both were in separate quiet areas closed off from other people. Information on the user is private and confidential, however, the participant is a new graduate and someone that I already know. In order to test the setting and materials, the test will be conducted as a mock usability test. The google form will be used as a questionnaire to evaluate the participant’s experience. Background questions, pretest, posttest, and demographic questionnaire serve to better understand the participant.

## Reflection

The pilot test helped gauge how another participant other than myself viewed the website. Notably, there were many similar criticisms that I also had towards the website. However, the participant proposed solutions to the problems I believed important from the heuristics. In the pilot test, I learned to become a better moderator. There is a lot of importance in understanding the participant and learning from their actions. The tasks were an essential indicator of what they thought of the website. I found some of the tasks were done more unique compared to how I would have approached them. It provided for areas of improvement since I found other problems unique to the website.

During the pilot usability test, the questionnaire Google form helped guide the process. The questions provided crucial information as they made the participant think and expand on why they chose to click on a link or their way to solving the tasks. It was important to have a good layout of questions and also answers so that they can confirm their choices since this test was about their experiences. As a moderator, I tried to stay neutral and positive. When I believed the participant was not as focused on the task, I helped challenge another possible task to expand on their thinking. Something that may have not worked well is being online. Unfortunately, we were in two separate locations and I was unable to use an in-person portable testing site. I believe being together in the same rooms allows for my guidance and comfortable testing. I would be able to moderate them more closely and observe their facial expressions more closely, compared to on a Zoom face camera.

As said, I prefer to do UT in person compared to online. Another area of improvement may have been to add another section to the questionnaire to test the participant on the tasks more accurately. Although my participant answered the tasks correctly, there could have been more expansions on the tasks to ensure that they were focused on the website design rather than the information on the site. Also, some of the answer choices on the questionnaire form may have been posed in another way to have the participant choose more meaningful responses. I noticed that they were very neutral in their responses, thus, it may make sense to include some more free-response choices rather than multiple-choice. Regardless, I enjoyed conducting this UT. I was able to look into the perspective of another user closely so that I can develop a better sense of the website’s flaws or successes. I truly learned a lot about the design of a UT and will incorporate these changes in the future.
