# Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing (UT)

### Tyler Nguyen | DGT HUM 110 | SPRING 2022

## Introduction

"A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site." -Usability.gov

**Playsongnotes.com** is a website that helps users develop their musical interests with the guitar. The site offers users videos and music sheets (with fees, some are free) of popular song covers on the guitar. These songs are sorted accordingly by age, genre, etc. Playsongnotes attempts to offer its users a balanced user interface, however, there are some usability issues (as seen in the heuristics). The rationale behind conducting this usability testing is to address these issues to see for further improvement. The test will help improve the user experience when the problems are clearly found.

We will be using a portable minimalist lab with Zoom meeting recording computer software to conduct the test. This allows for the moderator and participant to be in separate rooms, in this case, we chose to be in the same room. In order to test the setting and materials, the test will be conducted as a mock usability test. The google form will be used as a questionnaire to evaluate the participant’s experience.
