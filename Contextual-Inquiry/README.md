# Assignment 03: Qualitative User Research (Contextual Inquiry)

### Tyler Nguyen | DGT HUM 110 | SPRING 2022

## Research Goal and Requirement/Constraints

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

- This project will help users with little to no musical experience find the resources necessary to learn how to play songs, specifically on the guitar. It will help encourage people to develop their own unique learning experiences to enjoy playing the guitar in a learning manner as efficiently as possible.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

- The activity fulfills the user’s cognitive needs. A greater need for cognition comes from individuals who enjoy activities that have deliberation and brainstorming conditions. As playing the guitar and learning new songs helps provide them a feeling of accomplishment and creative success. Finding new songs to play guitar as well as keeping track of their learning progress will develop their own gained knowledge while fulfilling the natural curiosity of such people.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

- For the traditional solution that many, including the targeted demographic we are studying, use may be going to in-person classes or using a music book. Nowadays, with the increasing popularity of the internet, many resources are offered online. In this case, users can satisfy their needs more instantly with quicker gratification. These current solutions involve guitar learning apps on a mobile device.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

- Limitations that were found through traditional methods may be improved with technology. Since sometimes a user may be unable to access a live class with an instructor that may cost a lot more money, a quick tap of a mobile device can redirect users to apps full of knowledge. The information on the guitar learning apps or websites provides music sheets and listening features that can also listen to the user's guitar playing. Some of these apps can give feedback if the user is out of tune or play sample notes to help in other senses.

## Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)

- Demographics: Anyone with little to no experience playing the guitar. Specifically, older individuals have little time to learn and fully invest in a musical hobby as a result of their own personal work. High-school and above educated is preferred. Since anyone can learn an instrument, the ability to learn the guitar can be marketed to anyone mainstream without any personal characteristics.

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?

- Since the solution is to have more people learn the guitar, the context under which they can learn should be available anytime, anywhere. If users can click simply on their phone or computer to access the website to learn, the learning environment will be very broad. As long as the condition of having users consistently use the website/app regularly, the users can access it at home, outside, and even at night.

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?

- The opportunity for users to regularly access the activity is sufficient. Learning something new, even an instrument, comes with consistent practice. If the user can dedicate a small portion of their day to learning based on their skill level it will be beneficial. They can complete a new song on the guitar or learn a new chord depending on their experience.

## Research Method

> Using a combination of overt observation and active participation

- Overt observation: I would like to have my participant be comfortable while I observe them. I will be sure to have a presence but not disrupt their thoughts and interactions.
- Active participation: With the activity posed in the study, the participant will have the opportunity to demonstrate their motives and I will gain insights from it.
- Interview: I will be asking a lot of questions related to the act of learning music, while also better understanding the participant's character.

#### Details Preparing Interview

The interview is conducted in person, but the tools used to record the inquiry is on Zoom. Conducted in a comfortable apartment room, I will be taking notes on my tablet and allowing the participant to access the computer for the activity. The participant does play the guitar and is willing to learn music. Unfortunately, I did not have access to another face camera to record the interview. However, the screen share does capture parts of the activity. I used the script to guide the discussion while also adding context for specific questions.

## Insights from the interview

- What do you think is the most useful source of information for learning? Just for anyone?
> 8:30 : "I will say, really picking something that's really, really easy to begin with. Because as I point out before, picking up an instrument has a very steep learning curve, and things that you find easy might take someone that's completely new two weeks to pick up or like a month, you know, most people lack patience."

- Why did you choose this method (YouTube) compared to other video apps?
> 15:52 : "I noticed that they're really just teaching me the same techniques, or they're using the same techniques, that eventually I just picked up. So I don't need to, like, watch those videos. I mean, they only take like 15 minutes, but it's still 15 minutes of my time."

- Would you say like percussion helps you learn guitar in any way?
> 19:00 : "Well, yeah, I think percussion does force me to have good rhythms. But also, I think, in terms of musical ability, I definitely am more comfortable with having the tempo or like the rhythms."

- If you had to create a magical tool that would allow you to learn music as you want, what kind of tool would that be?
> 21:18 : "I wished there’s a tool that can like sort of summarize songs into like, difficulty level. So you know, people can kinda see like, oh, just this is like easy, this is like medium, and this is just hard."

## Reflection

Going into the interview I felt confident that I was going to be able to find new insights into musical learning. I had a good participant that was well experienced with music, and fortunately, the guitar. Overall, I felt like I gained a lot of insights into how musical learning was conducted as well as the benefits or drawbacks of online and in-person learning.

Some of the things I learned from the interview were from the perspective of an experienced learner. As a beginner, it makes more sense to start small and accomplishes more musical feats rather than progressing slowly through a difficult song. Also, I learned that musical (guitar) learners may not just use one website or app, instead, they may use multiple sources to help them learn. In this case, my participant used a chord website as well as YouTube, since they did not have access to the audio from the chord website. In addition, many people pursuing to learn a musical instrument may choose to join a group or band to help with their development. The participant revealed that in-person learning would benefit him even more so than learning online. This came as a surprise to me since online felt more convenient, however, it makes sense since the audio and instruction would not be as efficient over a connection.

After finishing the interview, there were many things that I could have done differently. Unfortunately, I was unable to record the face camera since I did not have access to one while taking notes. I was hoping also that I could engage more with the participant with the musical knowledge. My own musical ability is very limited so it would have been beneficial if I were to prepare or study some concepts before the interview in order to have a deeper conversation about learning music and relating more with the participant. As a role in an active observant, I felt I did well facilitating the discussion, but I would hope next time I could talk more about them and their own learning methods in more depth. I expand on this in my field notes. Regardless, I felt the interview was properly conducted and hope I can produce better interviews in the future.
